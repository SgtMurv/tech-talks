This is a collection of the materials used in all the tech talks that I have delivered.

## Talks Presented
### Introduction to Node.js
In this talk I focused on introducting Node.js. I cover things such as:
- What is Node.js?
- What projects you should use Node.js?
- What projects you should not use Node.js?
... There are also some useful code examples to back up the fundamentals I cover on Node.js :).
